# MedicalProtocols
CS 470 Senior Design Project:

This application was designed to allow a medical doctor, specialist, to design and publish "Protocols"
for specialized treatment plans.  These protocols would then be used by general practicioners to treat
and recommend action plans to patients.  It was designed and built under the guidance of a cardiologist and
is very nearly complete.

The user can open the application and navigete through the protocol of their chosing via the touch screen
on an ipad or iphone.  The superuser "specialist" may login via a two finger swipe on the screen and modify
or build protocols dynamically in the application.  Once the protocol has been modified or created, all other
instances of the application will be automatically updated through the noSql database in the cloud.  "Parse.com".
